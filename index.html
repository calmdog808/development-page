                        The goal here was to design an app to show list of items that you could filter and sort while learning React.

                    <p>
                        I have no React experience and was extremely tired, but if nothing else keeps me going, pastries and an overpriced drink will. So, I chose some basic items (pastries + drinks + ice cream) that you could filter (based on type + dietary restriction) and sort (by price + bestsellers the default) and even add to a favorites list that will keep track of the total of your selections.

                    <br>Honestly, I liked learning React and that it has so many design tools, so I didn't have to code a lot of components from scratch.
                    <br>  Not sure still what exactly a component is, but I know enough to start a bakery now.
